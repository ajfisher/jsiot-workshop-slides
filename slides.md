Andrew Fisher @ajfisher<!-- .element: class="author" -->

Notes:

Hi, my name is Andrew Fisher and I'm an interaction developer and I also build
hardware using JavaScript. Our workshop today is going to go for the two
sessions, so just under two hours and the aim is that by the end of it all of
you will have gone away having built something that interacts with the physical
world using JS. 

---

## TODO

1. Introduction to electronics & JS hardware stack
2. Building an API connected thing
3. Acquiring data from the environment

Notes:

Today, I've split things up so there's a bit of theory to get you familarised with the 
stack and some fundamental electronics you're going to need to know and then really
the majority of the time will be building stuff in a guided way with a focus on
building something that is in the physical environment and is being actuated from
a digital source and then reversing that and taking data from our environment
and doing things with it.

## Where are the droids?
<!-- .slide: data-background="/images/droids.jpg" -->

Notes:

Now, for those that might know a bit about nodebots or have been to a nodebots session before, whilst we're
using the nodebots stack (and I'll get into that in a moment), we won't be 
building full scale robots today due to not much time. As such I felt that given
there's some other topics at DDD around things like APIs, Microservices and IoT that this
would be a great opportunity to show you that not only can you build robots
with JS, but you can build IoT devices too and build them quickly and easily.

So if you were here for the robotics and you're a bit disappointed we're not
making battle bots this morning you've still got some time to go check out Troy's
security workshop or learn about APIs.

## Introduction to electronics

// some sort of pic

Notes:

Okay so let's get cracking. We'll start with some basic electronics. Enough to
get you by. Who here as done any electronics recently?

A handful okay, so we'll quickly touch on the simple bits you need to know for
today and where to find out more.

## Voltage, Current, Resistance

// Use image that is the pipes analogy

Notes:

The easiest way to think about electronics is like water and pipes. The wires
are pipes, the electrons or electricity is like water going through the pipes.

Voltage then is like the pressure. So if you imagine I have a big tank or I turn
on a mains tap there's a lot of pressure. So that's like having a powerful battery
or plugging in the powerpoint. This is measured in volts. All the stuff we'll 
use today is 5V which you can run from USB on your computer so won't kill you or
really probably blow anything up.

Current is the rate of flow of the electricity through the circuit. This is measured
in Amps. If you have a big motor attached to the circuit you can imagine it would
need more energy to turn it than a little LED. As such we say it draws a lot of
current - thus makes a lot of flow of electricity.

Finally we have resistance. Think of this like the width of the pipe. If it's
narrow maybe you can't draw much electricity through it but if it's fat then 
you can draw a lot. Some components may draw too much current so you use a
resistor to restrict the flow.

## Microcontrollers

// pic of arduino

Notes:

Okay - that's great, that's how electronics works in a circuit how do we affect it?

So we typically use a microcontroller. A microcontroller is like a really old computer
which you program in C and you can interact very directly with the circuit 
you wire up to it. Today, the micro we'll use is called an Arduino which is
open source hardware and very inexpensive. You can program it in C but you can
interact with it in JS and we'll come to that in a moment.

---

## Sensors and actuators (LEDs)

Notes:

Now a microcontroller is just a tiny little computer, you need to plug things
into it to do meaningful stuff. So the things we'll be playing around with 
today are things like this. LEDs emit light. They come in different colours and
one of them is even an RGB one which we'll use in the example.

Note that LEDs are polar so the long leg is the anode or the positive side.

---
## Sensors and actuators (Motors)


Notes:

Next up we have motors, and specifically servos which are used to move things 
normally thorugh 180Â° using a digital signal.

---

## Sensors and actuators (Temp)


Notes:

We'll be using a temperature sensor like this to record the temperature here
in the space and use it. These are very useful as they are inexpensive and 
remarkably accurate.


---

## Sensors and actuators (Light)


Notes:

And finally we have a light sensor which we'll use to measure light intensity.

---

## Resources

* Arduino Experimenters Kit (ARDX)
* Make: Electronics (C. Platt)
* Wikipedia (every component)

Notes:

There are a few resources you can go to to learn more about the basic electronics
but if you're interested, the Arduino Experimenters kit is a great place to start
as is the Make electronics book by Platt. Also Wikipedia has a frightening amount
of info on every component ever made.

Notes:

Okay so we're all software peeps so that's enough hardware to get you going. So
how do we get JS working with this microcontroller that I said a moment ago
can only use C.

## The NodeBots stack

![](/images/logo.png)

Notes:

There are a few different projects that can use JavaScript on hardware now,
however the one we're going to talk about is called nodebots as it's very much
aimed at a NodeJS implementation with hardware. At the core of nodebots are
transport layers to deal with things like talking over USB or wireless or serial
connections and then wrapped around that is a framework called Johnny Five.

## Johnny Five

[Joanne Daudier](https://twitter.com/jdaudier)

Notes:

Johnny Five was started by this guy - Rick Waldron, and there are now about
30 core project members, nearly 100 contributors and over 2000
commits to the codebase in the last couple of years. It's a very active and
expanding project and we're always looking for more contributors to help out.

Johnny Five is a hardware abstraction framework so instead of writing code that
is specific to a chip you can talk about components that behave in different
ways and leave the implementation details up to the people who write the 
board level interfaces whereupon you can then use it.

---

### The stack

* Controller board (sensors and actuators)
* IO Plugin (communications protocol)
* Johnny Five / NodeJS (application logic)
* WS/HTTP (networking and security protocols)
* Clients (UI, input, visualisation)

Notes:

So this is what the typical JS hardware stack looks like. 

We have a board which could have sensors and actuators. Actuators is just a
fancy word for something that does something in the real world - like a motor
or an LED etc. Most controller boards can't run JS yet so we normally need to 
put some firmware on them to do what we want.

This talks via a communications protocol to what is called an IO Plugin. IO
plugins are a Johnny Five idea that tries to get hardware to behave in consistent
ways via a protocol. Think of this sort of like HTTP requests and responses - the
client doesn't really care what the server does as long as it responds properly.

Johnny Five gives us hardware abstraction so we can turn motors and LEDs into 
JavaScript objects and interact with them. As a side effect we get all of NodeJS
as well so that means we can start doing interesting things like linking up
with our normal web protocols. And then finally we can add clients for things
like UI, input and what not.

---

### Common implementation

* Controller board (Arduino)
* IO Plugin (Firmata over USB)
* Johnny Five / NodeJS (application logic)
* WS/HTTP (networking and security protocols)
* Clients (UI, input, visualisation)

Notes:

So in practice this is what a specific implementation of this stack looks like.
You can see we've got an arduino board in this case and the IO Plugin is 
a firmware called Firmata which provides us the interface to the board for Johnny
Five. This is about the most basic and most common stack you can use but you can
see that the bit we are concerned about - being the bit in the middle pretty
much stays the same all the time.

---

## NodeBots hardware

* Servos, Motors, ESCs, Stepper motors
* Accelerometers, Gyroscopes, Compasses, IMUs
* Temperature, Proxitimity, Pressure sensors
* LEDs, NeoPixels, Pixel matrices
* Switches, Joysticks, Buttons
* LCDs

Notes:

In terms of hardware - there is a lot covered in Johnny Five and more core
components are still being added. The intent is to have the majority of the
most common electronics components you're likely to come across available in
the framework and then you can use then to compose bigger objects that then
represent your thing that you're making.

---

### Installation 

* Board development environment (eg Arduino)
* Flash board with protocol (eg Firmata)
* npm install johnny-five
* Write code
* ...
* Make an awesome JS Hardware thing

Notes:

So to get up and running, it's pretty much just a case of getting the board dev
environment going. For arduino that's prerry much just download the arduino
IDE and install it. You then put the IO protocol on the board that you need - 
for an arduinon that just means using Firmata and then it's an npm install
and you are then writing code.

Notes:

With all this power, what sort of things can you build? Well I'm going to show
you some examples of some fun things people have made and show you some code
as well.

Notes:

This is a basic teaching bot we use in Australia for nodebots events. Very
basic and allows you to explore fundamentals of robotics design and motion. It
is very cheap and fast to build so good for beginners.

Notes:

This skirt, made by Kassandra Perch is fully contained running javascript on a little board embedded into
it. It has an accelerometer and as you move around the LEDs inside it light up
different colour. So you can even use JavaScript in your clothing!!

Notes:

Here is an example of using nodeJS to make a physical game. This is made by 
Adrian Catalan and uses nodebots and node-pixel to make a tetris game on
LED panels.

Notes:

Donovan Buck has done a lot of work on making sophisticated animation control
in nodebots with a library to solve inverse kinematics problems. Here you 
can see he has attached a 6-leg robot to a leap motion for hand control and it
responds very very fast to his movement.

Notes:

So now you've seen some examples, let's see a demonstration. With hardware you 
most of the time don't have a screen. So a hello world example is just getting
an LED to blink on and off.
